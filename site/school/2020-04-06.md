# Math Monday

## April 6, 2020

Happy Math Monday! Here are some fun activities to do with your child using their counting skills!

1. Listen to [Learning Station's Counting Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1pSh6yuZFA)
2. Challenge:
    - JK students: "Let's see how high you can count! Can you count to 20?"
    - SK Students: "Let's try skip counting by 10s to 100!" (10, 20, 30, 40 ...)
    Try [this skip counting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8CEOIAGas)
3. Let's play a game of "I Spy". Let's find different circle shapes in our house! (e.g. cereal, CDs, buttons, clock, bracelet, etc). Let's make a list of the different items we found that were a circle shape.
4. Now let's listen to [a story called "Ten Black Dots" by Donald Crews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJhORhzF79E). What shape would the zero on the cover of the book be?
5. After the story, talk about the different shapes your child saw. "What was your favourite page? Why was it your favourite? Did you see any shapes in the story book (e.g. the triangle flag on the boat)?"
6. Students may make their own black dot illustration (see below for examples). They can use any materials they have at home, like construction paper, crayons, etc. Have your child count how many dots they drew. JK students you may help them write a sentence to go with their picture (e.g. two dots can make the eyes of a fox). You can also write their sentence in a yellow pencil crayon or marker and they can trace it! SK students: please encourage them to write the number of dots they used in their picture and to sound out some words in their sentence themselves.
7. When you are done, if you would like you can take a photo of your work and send it to your educators!

Hope you had fun!
